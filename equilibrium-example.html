    <h1>Getting to Equilibrium</h1>
    <!--     <p class="learning-objectives"><b>Learning objective </b>Learn how supply and demand meet.</p> -->
    <p>So far, we’ve described equilibrium as the point at which there’s no tendency for change. It’s also important
        because markets tend to move toward the point of supply-equals-demand equilibrium. As a result, you can use your
        analysis of equilibrium to predict whether prices are likely to rise or fall.</p>
    <h2>Shortages lead the price to rise.</h2>
    <p>Let’s begin by thinking about what happens when the price is below the equilibrium level. In Figure 1, the market
        for gasoline starts out at equilibrium, let’s say the price is $2. What happens when the price falls below
        equilibrium? To see for yourself, move the indicated point down.</p>
    <p>When the price of gas falls below the equilibrium point, a shortage will result: The quantity of gas demanded,
        noted by <em>Q<sub>D</sub></em>, is more than the quantity of gas supplied, noted by <em>Q<sub>S</sub></em>. There are too many
        people chasing too little gas, leading to the shortage! Notice that as you decrease the price further, the
        shortage becomes even more severe. As a result, individual gas stations find themselves selling out of gas, or
        facing long lines of desperate customers. How will suppliers and demanders respond to this shortage?</p>

    <h2>Surpluses lead the price to fall.</h2>
    <p>A similar process occurs in the reverse direction when the price is above its equilibrium. What happens when the
        price rises above the equilibrium price? To see for yourself, move the indicated point up and above the starting
        position.</p>
    <p>When the price of gas rises above the equilibrium point, a surplus will result: The quantity of gas supplied, noted
        by <em>Q<sub>S</sub></em>, is more than the quantity of gas demanded, noted by <em>Q<sub>D</sub></em>. Sellers are
        trying to sell gas to people who don’t want any more gas, leading to the shortage! Notice that as you increase the
        price further, the surplus becomes even more severe. As a result, individual gas stations find themselves sitting on
        unsold gas and will charge lower prices in the hopes of attracting more customers. With enough competition, repeated
        rounds of discounting will eliminate this surplus. </p>
